# module/firmware — STM32F429 reference (CMSIS-only)

> Reference implementation of `module/engineering_pack/README.md` §5
> (firmware) and `core/sscb/domain.md` §13 — same code, English-named
> identifiers. CMSIS-Core register-direct access only; no STM32 HAL/LL,
> no vendor SDK redistribution.

## What this is, and what it is not

| Verified here | Not verified here |
|---|---|
| Source-level integrity: every `engineering_pack` §5 function, struct, and macro is present and self-consistent | On-target behavior: 600 ns trip latency, T-1..T-9 acceptance |
| Host cross-compile to `firmware.elf` (build-time check only) | Hardware bring-up: requires STM32F429ZIT6 board + ST-Link |
| Memory map within stm32f429zi (`linker/stm32f429zi.ld`) | Closed-loop response: requires Pearson 110A + Tektronix MSO64 |
| Identifier sync with `engineering_pack` §5 / domain.md §13 | UL 489B short-circuit interrupt: requires 5 kA pulsed source jig |

CI in this repo can verify the first column. The second column is the
acceptance scope of `tests/test_acceptance.py` T-1..T-10 (all skipped for
the bench-only reason).

## Build

```bash
brew install --cask gcc-arm-embedded     # macOS
# or: sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi  # Debian/Ubuntu

make -C module/firmware check    # toolchain check
make -C module/firmware all      # → build/firmware.elf, .bin, .hex
make -C module/firmware size     # arm-none-eabi-size summary
make -C module/firmware clean
```

Targets `build/firmware.elf` etc. are `.gitignore`'d.

## Sync policy with engineering_pack §5

`engineering_pack/README.md` §5 is the authoritative spec; this directory is
the materialization. When §5 changes:

1. Update `engineering_pack/README.md` §5.x.
2. Mirror the change here in the matching `src/*.c` file.
3. Run `python3 verify/cross_doc_audit.py` — currently audits only the .md
   surfaces. Identifier-level drift between §5 and `src/` is caught at
   compile time, not at audit time.

If §5 introduces a new macro / struct member, it must appear in `include/sscb.h`
**before** the C source uses it. Don't extend `include/sscb.h` with
identifiers that have no source in §5 — that's silent firmware drift.

## Authority

Code-permitted location declared by `.own` own 3
(`hexa-sscb-doc-first-code-scope`). New `.c` files outside `src/` are
prohibited without first updating own 3's `decl 허용 위치 4` clause.
